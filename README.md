# Video Game Developer

### Education 
Computer Science, BS 2026 @ University of Michigan

### About Me!
1) I am terrible with favorites, so some honorable mentions: Stray, Mouthwashing, Stardew, the list goes on and on, but right now I would say Elden Ring! Kind of late to the party, but I have been playing it all summer when I've had the free time. I love highly immersive games, so the high average playthrough hours, the cryptic dialogue hiding deeper lore, and moral themes of the story line are a treat to experience. I am also in love with the mystic-dark fantasy creative direction, from the environments to literally any other design in the game. Sadly I'm not sure how much I'll be able to play once the semester starts ToT

2) I'm looking to gain experience in game development software, as I haven't taken a class that has given me that opportunity before. I have also always been interested in game development as a career path, as it combines the highly versatile field of computer science with various creative disciplines,  making video games a compound medium for storytelling, community, competitiveness etc. In short, a medium for art!

3) I do have a high interest in working in the gaming industry! I would love to work on any sort of game design, but my dream would to work on story-driven RPG games that have plenty of world-building aspects.
